**PROJECT MACHINE LEARNING**
============================

Hello world! welcome to my humble repository. Using python, my project implements the "Multi-class classification-based algorithm" to create a software which identifies the neuron cell type based on specific input cell characteristics.

**FOLDERS:**

- *project_raw_data:*
   contains "ram.xlsx" spreadsheet which holds the raw data in a column-row representation. 

- *results:*
  contains the results of the test cases made along the development of the project. The result files are in ".txt"           format.

- *source:*
  contains the "basic_functions.py" file which contains the code of the software. The file "tests" contains the     "test_read_data.py" file that has code designed to test the functions from the "basic_functions.py" file.

- *Final assignment:* 
  contains a written report about the project's background, description of the data, an outline of the code used to         create   the software. The report will provide a reference for potential reuse/reproducibility of the code generated.

**BUILD REQUIREMENTS:**

- Algorithm: Machine learning - Multi-class classification
- Programming language: python 3.5.2 | Anaconda 4.1.1 (64-bit).
- Format of original data files: .xlsx
- 3rd party/open source libraries: openpyxl
- Operation system: ubuntu 16.04 LTS|64-bit.
